What if you could ask Alexa about your flight status before heading out the door? We built a skill that connects Alexa to the [Laminar Flight API](https://rapidapi.com/package/LaminarFlightData/functions?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=AlexaLaminarTutorial_LaminarFunctionsAPI) so that you can ask Alexa the status of your flight. Even better? We created a video tutorial that walks you through every step of the process. Check out the video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_H6m2dJ6fo) or jump straight the code.
